name: Comparison of non-matching techniques for the finite element approximation of
  interface problems
description: "This code presents a comprehensive comparison of methods to address
  the Dirichlet condition in a fictitious domain approach with non-conformal mesh
  boundaries. The presented implementations are based on the C++ finite element library
  deal.II, and the methods compared include a Lagrange multiplier method, a Nitsche
  method derived from it, and a Nitsche method on cut elements. The primary aim is
  to provide a priori error estimates for each method, assessing computational cost
  and accuracy. \n\nThese results have been presented in a paper titled \"Comparison
  of non-matching techniques for the finite element approximation of interface problems\".
  The implementation leverages the capabilities of the CGAL library for computational
  geometry tasks, ensuring robust intersection routines. The research validates the
  implementations with varied experiments, considering different mesh configurations,
  algorithms, and boundary conditions. The results underscore the nuances of each
  method, providing insights into their applicability and performance in different
  scenarios."
